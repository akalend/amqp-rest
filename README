INTRODUCTION

The amqp-rest is hi-perfomance light (600K) HTTP server based libevent, realise two methods:

HTTP GET - the reading from queue one item by BASIC.GET AMQP method
HTTP POST - publish to exchange by BASIC.PUBLISH AMQP method
the result from broker return by json. Using in WEB/AJAX technologies.

curl http://10.0.0.1:8080/sss/q2     // get one item from queue "q2" 
{"result": "OK", "message":"message 2", size : 2}
// message is text message, size is queue size.
the name of queue is last part from url, after last slash (q_name): /any/path/and/q_name

read all messages: the url must have parm "?all"

curl http://10.0.0.1:8080/sss/q2?all
{"result": "OK", "count" : 2, messages ["message 3","the text\"xxxx\" tttt"]}
// 
read queue size: the url must have parm "?count"

curl http://10.0.0.1:8080/sss/q2?count
{"result": "Ok", "count": 3 }
ATTENTION the count use QUEUE.DECLARE method. If queue not exist - it will created.

publish to exchange "ex1" by key "news": the exchange name is last part from url, after last slash the routing key is url parm afret "?"

 curl -d 'some post data'  http://10.0.0.1:8080/sss/ex1?news 
{"result": "Ok"}

INSTALLATION

You must install the libevent http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
You must install amqpcpp lib http://code.google.com/p/rabbitcpp/
or http://github.com/akalend/amqpcpp

run Makefile;
copy amqp-rest to /usr/local/bin
copy n.cont to /usr/local/etc/amqp-rest.conf

edit the amqp-rest.conf

logfile /usr/local/var/amqp.log;        # logfile
pidfile /tmp/amqp.pid;  # pidfile

log_level notice; # the level of logging : error, notice, warning, debug
daemon   on;    # daemon mode

port 80;         # http port, default 80
http 10.0.0.1;  # bind IP

amqp :5672;     # amqp connection string  psw:login@host:port/vhost 
./amqp-rest <path to config file>
